## Inspiration
Watching GateGroup employees manually inspect 700 million passenger trays annually, making split-second decisions that lead to costly errors and delays. We realized operational chaos isn't unique to aviation. It's everywhere repetitive processes meet human variability.

## What it does
etagate is an AI platform that learns from examples to solve operational problems. Show it 7 correct and 3 incorrect examples, and it instantly creates a validation model. It combines voice control, real-time detection, and continuous learning to eliminate errors.

## How we built it
We built a flexible AI architecture that learns from visual examples rather than rigid rules. On the web platform, we used Laravel, Tailwind, and Alpine to create an intuitive interface for users to interact with models and monitor results. On the server side, we leveraged Python, Flask, and OpenCV to analyze images, generate models, and perform real-time detection. The platform is scalable, allowing one model to power multiple processes, and multiple models to combine into unified workflows.

## Challenges we ran into
Using AI to generalize from minimal examples while maintaining accuracy. Balancing real-time performance with detection precision. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Achieving instant model creation from just a handful of examples. Creating a platform that scales from one problem to infinite solutions without rebuilding infrastructure.

## What we learned
Operational excellence isn't about perfection, it's about consistent improvement. The best AI doesn't replace workers; it amplifies their capabilities. Simplicity in training (show examples) enables complexity in deployment.

## What's next for etagate
Expanding beyond aviation to manufacturing, logistics, and quality control. Building model marketplace where operations share solutions. Developing predictive capabilities that prevent errors before they happen. Making operational excellence accessible to every industry, everywhere.
